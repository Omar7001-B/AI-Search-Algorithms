# Naive Bayes Classifier Implementation ðŸ“Š

A Python implementation of the Naive Bayes classifier, a probabilistic machine learning algorithm based on Bayes' theorem.

## How It Works
- Uses Bayes' theorem: P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)
- Assumes feature independence (naive assumption)
- Calculates probability for each class
- Selects class with highest probability

## Features
- Multinomial Naive Bayes implementation
- Text classification support
- Simple and fast training
- Probability-based predictions
- Built-in cross-validation

## Implementation Details
- Handles text preprocessing
- Implements feature extraction
- Supports multiple classes
- Includes smoothing techniques
- Provides probability scores

## Usage
1. Prepare your text data
2. Run `naive_bayes.py`
3. Get classification results with probabilities

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- NumPy
- Pandas (for data handling)
- Scikit-learn (for preprocessing)

## Best For
- Text classification
- Spam detection
- Sentiment analysis
- Document categorization
