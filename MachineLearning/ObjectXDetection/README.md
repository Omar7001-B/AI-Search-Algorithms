# Object Detection Implementation ðŸ“·

A computer vision implementation for detecting and classifying objects in images and video streams.

## How It Works
- Processes input images/video frames
- Applies pre-trained detection model
- Identifies objects with bounding boxes
- Calculates confidence scores
- Labels detected objects

## Features
- Real-time object detection
- Multiple object class support
- Confidence threshold adjustment
- Non-maximum suppression
- Bounding box visualization

## Implementation Details
- Uses deep learning architecture
- Implements sliding window detection
- Supports various input formats
- Provides detection metrics
- Includes performance optimization

## Usage
1. Prepare input image/video
2. Run `object_detection.py`
3. View results with bounding boxes and labels

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- OpenCV
- NumPy
- TensorFlow/PyTorch
- CUDA (optional, for GPU acceleration)

## Best For
- Real-time surveillance
- Image analysis
- Autonomous systems
- Security applications

## Performance
- FPS depends on hardware
- GPU acceleration supported
- Adjustable precision-speed tradeoff
