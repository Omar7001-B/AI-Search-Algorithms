# N-Queens Solver with Genetic Algorithm ðŸ‘‘

An implementation of the N-Queens puzzle solver using genetic algorithm optimization.

## About the Problem
The N-Queens puzzle challenges you to place N chess queens on an NÃ—N chessboard where no two queens threaten each other. This means:
- No two queens share the same row
- No two queens share the same column
- No two queens share the same diagonal

## How to Use
1. Run `Queens (Genetic).py`
2. Enter the board size (N) when prompted
3. Watch as the genetic algorithm evolves to find a valid solution
4. The solution will show queen positions on the board

## Algorithm Details
- Uses genetic algorithm for optimization
- Implements:
  - Population evolution
  - Crossover operations
  - Mutation operations
- Finds a valid solution through natural selection simulation
