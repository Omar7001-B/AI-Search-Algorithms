# Tic-Tac-Toe with Minimax AI ðŸŽ®

A classic implementation of Tic-Tac-Toe where you play against an unbeatable AI powered by the Minimax algorithm.

## How It Works
The Minimax algorithm works by:
- Simulating all possible game states
- Evaluating each outcome
- Choosing the move that maximizes AI's chances while minimizing the player's chances

## How to Play
1. Run `Tic Toe (Minimax).py`
2. The board positions are numbered 1-9:
```
1 | 2 | 3
---------
4 | 5 | 6
---------
7 | 8 | 9
```
3. Enter a number (1-9) when prompted
4. Try your best to win (though it's impossible! ðŸ˜‰)

## Algorithm Details
- Uses Minimax algorithm for decision making
- Implements alpha-beta pruning for optimization
- Guarantees optimal play from the AI
